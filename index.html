    <h1>Learn C program basics</h1>
    
    <p><i>
              C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to
      develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on.
      C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.
    </p>
    <P>C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system.[6] During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages,[7][8] with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization.</P>
